# An introductory guide to AlphaFold’s strengths and limitations

Proteins are foundational components of life. Each protein molecule has a distinctive 3D shape that dictates its functions, such as catalysing (speeding up) a biochemical reaction or enabling muscular contractions. Accurately predicting a protein’s structure enables us to better understand its functions and roles.

## By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Recall the significance of the protein folding problem.
- Evaluate the fundamental concepts behind AlphaFold and why it is considered a significant breakthrough in protein structure prediction.
- Describe the strengths and limitations of AlphaFold’s structure predictions.
