# Validation and impact

Are AlphaFold structures “just structure predictions”? Are they even close to the experimentally determined structures? Are they good enough for any research use? This section answers these questions.

### By the end of this section you will be able to:

* Explain how AlphaFold structure predictions were validated experimentally
* Describe the use of confidence scores to assess AlphaFold structure predictions
* Recall the diverse potential research uses of AlphaFold and recognise AlphaFold’s role in advancing diverse areas of scientific research
