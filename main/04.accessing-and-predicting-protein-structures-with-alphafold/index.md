# Accessing and predicting protein structures with AlphaFold 2

AlphaFold2 is a powerful tool for protein structure prediction. However, the best way to access it depends on your specific needs and resources. The main options are:

* Using the AlphaFold2 [source code](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) for protein structure prediction.
* A cloud-based approach via [ColabFold](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb).
* Accessing the free [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) Developed by Google DeepMind in collaboration with EMBL-EBI, it offers a user-friendly interface and over 200 million predicted protein structures.
* Using specialised software that incorporates AlphaFold algorithm and/or data.

### By the end of this section you will be able to:

* Describe the key differences between using the AlphaFold source code, Google Colab notebooks or the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database to predict protein structures.
* Determine the best approach to using AlphaFold, based on your computational resources, coding experience and need for customisation.
* Recall the ways to access the pre-computed predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.
* Identify other resources for accessing and predicting structures of proteins and macromolecules.
