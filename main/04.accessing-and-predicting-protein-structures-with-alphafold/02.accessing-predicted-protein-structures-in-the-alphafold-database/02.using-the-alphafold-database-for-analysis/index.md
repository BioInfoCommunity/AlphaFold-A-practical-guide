# Using the AlphaFold database for analysis

This section explores how the AlphaFold Database (AFDB) can be used to analyse protein structures and their relationships. Weâ€™ll delve into two powerful features: clustering and Foldseek.

### By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Understand how proteins are clustered in the AFDB based on sequence and structural similarity.
* Access and interpret cluster information to gain insights into protein function and evolution.
* Perform structure-based searches using Foldseek to identify proteins with similar folds, even with low sequence similarity.
* Interpret Foldseek results, including E-values and RMSD values, to assess structural similarity.
