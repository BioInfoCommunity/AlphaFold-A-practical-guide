# Evaluating AlphaFold2â€™s predicted structures using confidence scores

In order to hold practical significance, predicted protein structures must be accompanied by reliable measures of confidence. AlphaFold2 returns two confidence measures called pLDDT and PAE. These metrics can be used to identify regions of the predicted structure, and relative positions of different regions, that are more or less reliable. All predicted structures should be interpreted critically and in the light of these confidence scores.
