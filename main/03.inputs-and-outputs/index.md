# Inputs and outputs

How does AlphaFold predict a protein structure? Why are confidence metrics important? AlphaFold is not perfect and its predictions can sometimes be inaccurate. By understanding these confidence metrics, we can make informed decisions about how to use the predicted structures and identify where further research is needed.

### By the end of this section you will be able to:

* Recall the importance of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in the prediction of protein structures using AlphaFold.
* Explain how to interpret confidence scores, specifically by interpreting PAE (Predicted Aligned Error) and  pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test).
* Analyse predicted structures from AlphaFold by integrating the different confidence metrics.
