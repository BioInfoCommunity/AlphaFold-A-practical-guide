# AlphaFold 3 and AlphaFold Server

AlphaFold 3 is a new version of AlphaFold. It has additional capabilities, especially the ability to predict the structures of complexes containing multiple non-protein molecules (e.g. DNA, RNA, ligands). For non-commercial projects, AlphaFold 3 is available as a service via [AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/) and as source code via the [AlphaFold 3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3).

This section assumes familiarity with AlphaFold 2. This includes an understanding of the confidence scores, strengths, and limitations, as well as a grasp of the underlying technology. For those new to AlphaFold, it is highly recommended to read the first section, “[What is AlphaFold?](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/an-introductory-guide-to-its-strengths-and-limitations/what-is-alphafold/)” as it covers essential principles that are foundational to understanding both AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3.

### By the end of this section you will be able to:

* Understand what AlphaFold 3 can and can’t do.
* Determine whether to use AlphaFold 2 or AlphaFold 3 to help with your research questions.
* Generate AlphaFold 3 structure predictions using AlphaFold Server for non-commercial projects.
* Interpret the structure predictions provided by AlphaFold 3.
