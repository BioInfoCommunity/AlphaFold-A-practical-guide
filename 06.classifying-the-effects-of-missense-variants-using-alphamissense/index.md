# Classifying the effects of missense variants using AlphaMissense

AlphaMissense is a new tool, based on AlphaFold2 but separate from it. It can predict whether a missense variant is likely to be pathogenic. Like AlphaFold2, AlphaMissense supplies confidence metrics to enable careful interpretation of its predictions.

### **By the end of this section, you will be able to:**

* Understand the significance of missense variants for biomedical research
* Understand how to use AlphaMissense to explore whether or not a missense variation is likely to be pathogenic
* Critically interpret AlphaMissense predictions using both confidence metrics and an understanding of the scores limitations
